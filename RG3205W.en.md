## Kiosk escaping

**WORK IN PROGRESS**, hopefully we will update it in the week of *el puente de la Constitución* (November 6, 2022).

You don't need (and likely difficult) to install Linux like with model `IGW-5000A2BKMP-I v2` to repurpose it, but since we haven't found a way to exploit the easycwmp TR-069 client yet, you'll have to dissemble and solder a USB connector to connect a keyboard to do stuff.

If yours has a `Rev.4` PCB then you are very lucky that it comes with both micro USB and USB-C connectors already soldered and functioning!

But unfortunately, the more common one is `Rev.5` which not only doesn't come with the connectors but also lacks some components to be able to use the USB ports, we are still investigating what components are missing.

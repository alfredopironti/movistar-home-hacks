[Research notes](researches/IGW5000.md)

## HELP NEEDED

I dumped the original Android-x86 firmware from flash, but it failed to boot after I wrote it back in, and the /data partition was encrypted and I couldn't find a way to decrypt it.

Contributions to the [repository](https://github.com/zry98/movistar-home-hacks) are very welcomed if you've got any discoveries; or if you have a Movistar Home not in use and willing to help this project, please join our [Telegram group chat](https://t.me/movistar_home_hacking), much appreciated!

### TODO list

- [ ] Fix sound card driver (maybe [ALSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) configs)
- [ ] Fix camera driver
- [ ] Fix bluetooth driver
- [ ] Fix reset button
- [ ] Find a way to install Linux without disassembling nor soldering (maybe through [easycwmp on port 7547](researches/IGW5000.md#easycwmp))

## Linux installation

### Disassembling

Disassemble the device, it has **10 snap-fits** under the back panel edges, be careful not to damage them; then **8 screws** under the panel, and **4 screws** hidden under the rubber strip at the bottom of the device.

Locate the unpopulated micro USB port on the left edge of the motherboard:

![inside-with-usb-port-location](img/inside-with-usb-port-location.jpg)

Solder a micro USB female connector and connect an OTG adapter cable; or just solder a cable with a standard USB-A female connector to it, then short the fourth pin (or the `ID` pad) to the ground (GND, the fifth pin), making the device function as an OTG host.

Here is an example for soldering a USB-A female connector:

![igw5000-usb-port-connection-1](img/igw5000-usb-port-connection-1.jpg)

Flash a USB drive with your favorite Linux distro, I recommend using Xfce desktop environment considering the Movistar Home only has 2 GB RAM.

Connect a keyboard and the drive to a USB hub and connect it to Movistar Home. Power it up while pressing the `F2` key, it will boot into BIOS setup, navigate to the last tab (`Save & Exit`), select your USB drive (should be something like `UEFI: USB, Partition 1`) in the `Boot Override` menu, press `Enter` key to boot it.

![bios](img/bios.jpg)

Install your Linux distro as usual, it might be necessary to include non-free drivers.

It's recommended to set up the OpenSSH server before unsoldering the USB connector and reassembling the device, for possible future maintenance.

## Configurations

The following configurations were made for Manjaro with XFCE and may need some modifications for other distros or desktop environments.

### Fix screen rotation

Install the driver `xf86-video-intel` with the command `sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel`.

Create file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-monitor.conf` with the following content:

```plaintext
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier    "DSI1"
    Option        "Rotate" "right"
    Option        "DPMS" "true"
EndSection

Section "ServerFlags"
    Option        "StandbyTime" "0"
    Option        "SuspendTime" "0"
    Option        "OffTime"     "0"
EndSection
```

In Xfce's display settings, adjust the scaling to your liking, I found 0.8x the most suitable for this screen (1024x640).

### Fix touch screen

For some reason the touch screen won't work at all unless it's soft rebooted once, in dmesg the driver says "*Goodix-TS i2c-GDIX1001:00: Invalid config (0, 0, 0), using defaults*".

Create file `/etc/systemd/system/fix-touchscreen.service` with the following content:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Fix touchscreen

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=sh -c 'dmesg | grep -q " Goodix-TS .*: Invalid config " && reboot now || exit 0'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable fix-touchscreen.service` to make it run at startup.

To fix rotation, create file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchscreen.conf` with the following content:

```plaintext
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier      "calibration"
    MatchProduct    "Goodix Capacitive TouchScreen"
    Option          "TransformationMatrix" "0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1"
EndSection
```

#### Fix touch control in Firefox

*Source: [Firefox/Tweaks - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox/Tweaks#Enable_touchscreen_gestures)*

Open Firefox and access `about:config`, search for `dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled` and make sure it's either set to 1 (*enabled*) or 2 (*default, auto-detect*).

Add `MOZ_USE_XINPUT2 DEFAULT=1` to `/etc/security/pam_env.conf`.

### Auto backlight dimming

Modify file `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` to include `i915` and `pwm-lpss-platform` in the `MODULES` array as below:

```plaintext
...
MODULES=(i915 pwm-lpss-platform)
...
```

Then execute `sudo mkinitcpio -P` to regenerate the initramfs.

Create file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-intel.conf` with the following content:

```plaintext
Section "Device"
    Identifier    "Intel Graphics"
    Driver        "intel"
    Option        "AccelMethod" "sna"
    Option        "TearFree"    "true"
    Option        "Backlight"   "intel_backlight"
EndSection
```

Open Xfce's `Power Manager`, switch to `Display` tab, and adjust the `Brightness reduction` settings. I personally set it to reduce to 20% after 90 seconds of inactivity.

Remember also to disable the auto suspension/shutdown from there.

Create file `/etc/udev/rules.d/backlight.rules` with the following content:

```plaintext
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="intel_backlight", RUN+="/bin/chgrp video $sys$devpath/brightness", RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w $sys$devpath/brightness", ATTR{brightness}="100"
```

And better to disable the systemd-backlight service with `sudo systemctl mask systemd-backlight@backlight\:intel_backlight.service`, to prevent it from interfering.

### Virtual keyboard

Install [*Onboard*](https://launchpad.net/onboard) with `sudo pacman -S onboard`, open Xfce's `Session and Startup` settings, switch to `Application Autostart` tab, find and enable `Onboard (Flexible onscreen keyboard)`.

After rebooting, open Onboard's settings and adjust them to your liking.

### Hide mouse cursor

Install [*unclutter*](https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes) with `sudo pacman -S unclutter`.

Create file `~/.config/autostart/hide-cursor.desktop` with the following content:

```systemd
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=0.9.4
Type=Application
Name=Hide Cursor
Comment=Hide mourse cursor
Exec=unclutter --hide-on-touch
OnlyShowIn=XFCE;
RunHook=0
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=false
Hidden=false
```

### Home Assistant dashboard

Create file `~/.config/autostart/HASS.desktop` with the following content:

```systemd
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=0.9.4
Type=Application
Name=HASS Dashboard
Comment=Run HASS dashboard in Firefox kiosk
Exec=firefox -kiosk -url 'https://your.hass.url'
OnlyShowIn=XFCE;
RunHook=0
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=false
Hidden=false
```

This will run Firefox in kiosk mode at startup, which you can only exit by pressing `Alt+F4` or using `kill` command over SSH.

### Control display state from Home Assistant

> [!TIP]
> As mentioned in [ArchLinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xfce#Display_blanking), for `xset` to be able to control DPMS, you need to disable:
>  1. Screen dimming in Xfce's `Power Manager`.
>  2. Xfce's `XScreenSaver`.

Create file `~/panel_server.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import logging
import os
from subprocess import run
from time import sleep

from flask import Flask, request
from werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response

TOKEN = os.environ.get('TOKEN', '')


class middleware():
    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app

    def __call__(self, env, start_resp):
        request = Request(env)
        if TOKEN != '' and request.headers.get('Authorization') != f'Bearer {TOKEN}':
            res = Response('Unauthorized', mimetype='text/plain', status=401)
            return res(env, start_resp)
        return self.app(env, start_resp)


app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = middleware(app.wsgi_app)
log = logging.getLogger('werkzeug')
log.setLevel(logging.ERROR)


@app.route('/display/state', methods=['GET'])
def get_display_state():
    cmd = f"xset -display :0.0 q | grep '^  Monitor is' | awk '{{print $NF}}'"
    state = run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True).stdout.decode().strip()
    if state == 'On':
        return 'ON', 200
    elif state == 'Off':
        return 'OFF', 200
    else:
        return f'Unknown state "{state}"', 500


@app.route('/display/state', methods=['POST'])
def set_display_state():
    req_body = request.get_data().decode()
    if req_body == 'OFF':
        cmd = f'xset -display :0.0 dpms force off'
    elif req_body == 'ON':
        cmd = f'xset -display :0.0 dpms force on'
    else:
        return 'Bad Request', 400

    ret = run(cmd, shell=True).returncode
    if ret == 0:
        return req_body, 200
    else:
        return f'Command returned {ret}', 500


def init_display():
    while True:
        out = run(f"xset -display :0.0 q | grep '^  DPMS is '", shell=True, capture_output=True).stdout.decode()
        if 'Disabled' in out or 'Enabled' in out:
            break
        sleep(3)
    ret = run(f'xset -display :0.0 dpms force on', shell=True).returncode
    if ret != 0:
        print(f'Failed to turn on display: command returned {ret}')
        exit(ret)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    init_display()

    app.run(host=os.environ.get('HOST', '0.0.0.0'), port=os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
```

Run `sudo pacman -S python-flask` to install *Flask*.

Create file `~/.config/systemd/user/panelserver.service` with the following content:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Panel Server
After=network-online.target nss-lookup.target graphical-session.target

[Service]
Environment="TOKEN=aa83720a-0bc1-4d5b-82fc-bf27a6682aa4"  # replace it with your secret token
NoNewPrivileges=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/panel/panel_server.py  # replace it with your actual path
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then execute `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now panelserver.service` to make it run at startup.

Create a [RESTful switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.rest/) in your Home Assistant's YAML config like:

```yaml
- platform: rest
  name: Panel Display
  unique_id: panel_display
  resource: http://panel:8080/display/state  # replace `panel` with your panel's hostname or IP address
  body_on: 'ON'
  body_off: 'OFF'
  is_on_template: '{{ value == "ON" }}'
  headers:
    Authorization: Bearer aa83720a-0bc1-4d5b-82fc-bf27a6682aa4  # replace it with your secret token (after `Bearer `)
  verify_ssl: false
  icon: mdi:tablet-dashboard
```

Reload your Home Assistant instance, use *Developer Tools* to test the switch and sensor.

Then you can use it in Automations, e.g., turn it off when you go to sleep at night and turn it back on when you get up in the morning.

### Prevent screen burn-in

Since it will mostly be used to display a Home Assistant dashboard 24/7, it's very likely to get [screen burn-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in) after some time, although it has an LCD screen.

To prevent that, I wrote a Python script to have it periodically flash several colors in full screen to refresh all the pixels, it also refreshes the browser tab at the same time, to prevent any possible stuck.

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT USE this script if you or a family member has [photosensitive epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_epilepsy)!**

Create file `/usr/bin/screensaver.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import threading
import tkinter as tk
from subprocess import run
from time import time

color_interval = int(os.environ.get('COLOR_INTERVAL', 300))  # milliseconds
total_time = int(os.environ.get('TOTAL_TIME', 10))  # seconds, exit after that
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'black', 'white']

root = tk.Tk()
w, h = root.winfo_screenwidth(), root.winfo_screenheight()
root.overrideredirect(True)
root.attributes('-fullscreen', True)
canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=w, height=h, background='black', highlightthickness=0)
canvas.pack()
canvas.focus_set()
canvas.bind('<Button-1>', lambda _: root.destroy())  # exit on touch

color_index = 0


def show_color():
    global color_index
    if time() - time_start > total_time:
        root.destroy()
        return
    canvas.configure(background=colors[color_index])
    color_index = (color_index + 1) % len(colors)
    root.after(color_interval, show_color)


def refresh_browser(window_class: str):
    window_id = run(f'xdotool search --onlyvisible --class "{window_class}" | head -1',
                    shell=True, capture_output=True).stdout.decode().strip()
    ret = run(f'xdotool windowactivate {window_id}', shell=True).returncode
    if ret != 0:
        print(f'Failed to activate window {window_id}')
    ret = run(f'xdotool key F5', shell=True).returncode
    if ret != 0:
        print(f'Failed to send F5 key to window {window_id}')


# refresh browser window
browser_window_class = os.environ.get('BROWSER_WINDOW_CLASS', '')
if browser_window_class:
    refresh_thread = threading.Thread(target=refresh_browser, args=(browser_window_class,))
    refresh_thread.start()
# screensaver
time_start = time()
show_color()
root.mainloop()
```

Install the required packages with `sudo pacman -S tk xdotool`, run command `sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/screensaver.py` to make it executable, then run command `crontab -e` and add a cron job as following, which will run the script every hour:

```crontab
0 * * * *	DISPLAY=:0 COLOR_INTERVAL=300 TOTAL_TIME=10 BROWSER_WINDOW_CLASS="firefox" /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/screensaver.py
```

Adjust the two environment variables `COLOR_INTERVAL` and `TOTAL_TIME` to your liking, with a `TOTAL_TIME` of 10 it will be running for 10 seconds. If you need to stop it immediately, just touch the screen.

If you use another browser (e.g., `chromium`), change the value of `BROWSER_WINDOW_CLASS` accordingly; if you don't want to refresh the browser tab, make it empty (`BROWSER_WINDOW_CLASS=""`).
